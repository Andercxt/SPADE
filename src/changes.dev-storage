CHANGES MADE IN dev-storage BRANCH:
1. Removed adding annotation for type in Edge and Vertex classes.
2. Added hash as constant PRIMARY_KEY in SQL.java.
3. Added implementation for 4 new functions with '_new' suffix.
4. Changed primary key of tables to hash and removed the surrogate key.
5. Improved the putVertex and putEdge functions implementation.
6. During postgres transactions, exceptions should not arise if autoCommit is set to false, otherwise the rest of the transaction block is cancelled.
7.  



Performance points:
1. Use string concatenation for query construction. Compiler automatically uses string builder underneath.
2. Use string builder when constructing query in a loop. If you don't, compiler will create one per loop iteration.
3. Use md5 hash to store in UUID field of Postgres and Neo4j. Its suitable for the 128 bit format. Use md5Hex from DigestUtils.
4.
